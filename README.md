Daily UI 004

I was delaying this challenge for quite some time! And with a reason, and that reason is: GRID SYSTEM!!!
I can't express just how much I hate grids! I think this comes from first lessons in HTML/CSS that 
were done in freeCodeCamp and Codecademy, and let me tell you; those lessons were confusing! And, of course
I decided to do grids and completely ignore flexbox. As expected, I spent week slamming my head on table wondering 
where I messed up. 

I do admit that grids are not that scary anymore, especially when they are done with Bootstrap (I haven't tried to 
do them in just CSS YET), but this time I also used more CSS. Especially since I read article in which they explain
most common mistakes done when using Bootstrap, and apparently one of those mistakes was, thinking that you don't
need CSS and that Bootstrap is all you need!

Well, mistake corrected! 

Well, see ya soon in next project!
